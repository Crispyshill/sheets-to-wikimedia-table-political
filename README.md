# sheets-to-wikimedia-table-political
Converts google sheets of election data into wikimedia table equivilent.
## Purpose:
I was requested by a freequent editor of wikipedia to create this application to his specifications. A similar application on github already exists, however it used native Javascript, which does not have access to merge data of cells in a sheet, and also did not add political party shading to cells.

This application solves both of those issues by using Google App Script. In this current form, the script is intended to be run as a web application.
